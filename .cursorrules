## Version & Compatibility
- This is a v0 project - **backward compatibility is NOT a concern**
- Feel free to refactor, update, and improve code without maintaining old APIs
- Focus on clean, modern code rather than supporting legacy patterns
- Breaking changes are acceptable - prioritize code quality and maintainability

## Shell Environment
- The user uses PowerShell on this machine
- PowerShell version: 7.5.4
- When running terminal commands, use PowerShell syntax and commands
- Use `pwsh` or `powershell` commands as appropriate
- Path separators should use backslashes for Windows paths when needed

## Code Style
- Prefer modern TypeScript patterns
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Break down complex functions into smaller, focused utilities
- Don't hesitate to refactor for better structure and readability

## User Portability & Project Structure
- **CRITICAL**: End users will use YAMA as a library/framework in their own projects
- **NEVER assume** users have a `packages/` folder or monorepo structure
- **NEVER assume** users are developing YAMA itself - they are using it as a dependency
- Users' project structure will differ from the development structure (this repo has `packages/` but users won't)
- Always default to published package versions (e.g., `"latest"` or specific versions) for end users
- Workspace detection should only be used for development convenience, never required for functionality
- When generating code or solutions:
  - Use standard npm/pnpm/yarn package installation patterns
  - Reference packages by their published names (e.g., `@yama/core`, `yama-cli`)
  - Never hardcode paths to `packages/` folder
  - Never assume workspace structure exists
  - Keep solutions generic and portable across different project structures
- Avoid custom solutions that:
  - Reduce portability
  - Assume specific project layouts
  - Require monorepo structure
  - Make assumptions about directory structure beyond standard conventions
- When in doubt, prefer the solution that works for standalone projects over workspace-specific optimizations
