# Deployment

Learn how to deploy your Yama applications to various platforms.

## Quick Deploy

Yama applications can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js:

- **Serverless** - Vercel, Netlify, AWS Lambda
- **Containers** - Docker, Kubernetes
- **Traditional** - VPS, Cloud providers

## Build for Production

Before deploying, build your application:

```bash
yama build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment Options

### Serverless Platforms

Deploy to serverless platforms for automatic scaling:

- [Vercel](/deployment/vercel) - Zero-config serverless deployment
- [AWS Lambda](/deployment/aws-lambda) - AWS Lambda functions
- Netlify - Coming soon

### Container Platforms

Deploy using Docker containers:

- [Docker](/deployment/docker) - Container-based deployment
- Kubernetes - Coming soon

## Environment Variables

Configure environment variables for your deployment:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Database Migrations

Run migrations before deploying:

```bash
yama schema:apply
```

Or configure automatic migrations in your deployment pipeline.

## Health Checks

Yama provides health check endpoints:

- `GET /health` - Application health
- `GET /ready` - Readiness check
- `GET /live` - Liveness check

Use these for Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes.
