# Core Concepts

Yama is built around a few core concepts that work together to create powerful APIs with minimal code.

## Schemas

Schemas define the structure and validation rules for your data. They're reusable definitions that can be referenced throughout your configuration.

```yaml
schemas:
  User:
    type: object
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        format: uuid
      email:
        type: string
        format: email
      name:
        type: string
```

## Entities

Entities represent database tables and provide automatic CRUD operations. They're built on top of schemas and add database-specific configuration.

```yaml
entities:
  User:
    table: users
    crud:
      enabled: true
    fields:
      id:
        type: uuid
        primary: true
```

## Endpoints

Endpoints define your API routes. They can use handlers for custom logic or leverage automatic CRUD operations from entities.

```yaml
endpoints:
  - path: /users
    method: GET
    handler: handlers/listUsers
    response:
      type: UserArray
```

## Handlers

Handlers contain your business logic. They're TypeScript functions that receive a context object with database access, authentication, and more.

```typescript
export async function listUsers(context: HandlerContext) {
  const users = await context.entities.User.findAll();
  return users;
}
```

## How They Work Together

1. **Schemas** define your data structure
2. **Entities** add database operations to schemas
3. **Endpoints** expose your data via HTTP
4. **Handlers** implement custom business logic

This separation allows you to:
- Define structure in YAML (version-controlled, AI-friendly)
- Write logic in TypeScript (type-safe, testable)
- Let Yama handle routing, validation, and code generation
