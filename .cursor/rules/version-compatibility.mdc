## Version & Compatibility
- This is a v0 project - **backward compatibility is NOT a concern**
- Feel free to refactor, update, and improve code without maintaining old APIs
- Focus on clean, modern code rather than supporting legacy patterns
- Breaking changes are acceptable - prioritize code quality and maintainability
